🐍 Python Pyramid Patterns – Collection of 65 Programs

This repository contains a complete collection of 65 Python Pyramid Pattern Programs, written using simple and direct Python code.
Each program focuses on pattern logic, nested loops, and console-based structural printing.
The main purpose of this repository is to help beginners and learners understand how different pyramid shapes are built using rows, columns, spacing, alignment, and number or character sequences.

Python pattern printing is one of the most requested topics for beginners, logic-building practice, coding exercises, and school/college examinations.
These 65 programs cover star patterns, number patterns, alphabet patterns, mixed patterns, mirrored shapes, inverted shapes, hollow shapes, solid shapes, and more.

All programs are created using straightforward and clean Python code, without libraries or complex functions, so learners can easily understand the logic behind each shape.

▶️ Sample Direct Code (Example Pattern)

Here is one sample program to demonstrate the style and simplicity used in the repository:

rows = int(input("Enter number of rows: "))

for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=" ")
    print()

Output:

1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5

All 65 programs follow a similar format:
straightforward loops, clear logic, and no extra code.
